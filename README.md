# first_app
This is my first flutter mobile application, A dice roller.
I used a stateless as well as a stateful widget along with the material app design feature of Flutter to design it.

I could use the Random() class to generate the pick my png images in the asset/images folder to randomize the dice images.
Apart from that, I learned about building custom widgets and basic UI features of the Flutter framework, type-safe data types, and name and positional arguments is also a plus point.
